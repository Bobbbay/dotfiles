# Setting up fonts in Alacritty is simple - just throw in the name
# and variation, and you're in. Iosevka is probably *the* best font
# for terminals, hence here we declare we want to use Iosevka. Note
# the last line of the chunk, where we mention the font size.
font:
  normal:
    family: Iosevka
    style: Regular
  bold:
    family: Iosevka
    style: Bold
  italic:
    family: Iosevka
    style: Italic
  size: 10.0

# Here we declare the padding - self-explanatory for most people. I like
# having a super-duper small amount of padding, just to make sure the
# setup looks clean, but not stuffy.
padding:
  x: 2
  y: 2


# Here we set the scrolling settings. The maximum history is 10 000, so
# we set it as much. Then, we have the scroll multiplier - how much does
# one scroll from our mouse affect the layout scroll shift? Thanks to my
# awesome, 1000-line-scrolling mouse, I keep this at 1, nice and low.
scrolling:
  history: 100000
  multiplier: 1

# Here, we declare us some colors. This is my slightly modified Base16
# Gruvbox Dark theme. It looks sexy, and is super light.
colors:
  normal:
    black: "#fbf1c7"
    red: "#af3a03"
    orange: "#b57614"
    yellow: "#79740e"
    green: "#427b58"
    cyan: "#076678"
    magenta: "#8f3f71"
    blue: "#076678"
    white: "#ffffff"

# Here we can declare keybindings. I generally don't need these - but
# just for the idea, I've added a Ctrl+N binding. I personally admire how
# well these are managed by alacritty.
key_bindings:
 - { key: N,             mods: Control,         action: SpawnNewInstance     }

# Here, we declare the cursor style - in this case, The Beam. It looks
# clean and gets the job done well. The cursor, by default, will become
# a hollow square when the window is unfocused.
cursor:
  style: Beam

# Debugging isn't really something you'd see in most setups -
# but I thought I'd give it a try. This small, and final, section
# declares persistent logging. This way, alacritty won't delete its
# log files when quitting.
debug:
  persistent_logging: true
